            <h2>What exactly is this outrageously decadent event?</h2>
            <p>This event unfolds in just the way that the name implies: we drink and drink and drink! And then when we think we've had enough... We drink some more! Hooray!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="faq-sections">
            <h2>How was this amazing tradition formed?</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2018, Kevin and Falyn were freshly graduated from Texas A&M (Whoop!) and trying to find one last way to go out with a boom before the curtains closed on summer. 
                So we thought to ourselves: "what better way to celebrate summer and punish our pesky livers at the same time, than to drink copoius amounts of alcohol???" 
                And just like that, our favorite tradition was born.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="faq-sections">
            <h2>There's got to be more to it, right?</h2>
            <p>For the most part, it really is that simple. There's a lot of alcohol and we drink as much of it as we can. But of course, sitting around a room and consuming large 
                quantities of alcohol has its limit on being fun, so during Drinkpocalypse we also spend as much time as we can at the pool in order to really bask in not just the sun, 
                but the full glory of summer and all that it has to offer us as well!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="faq-sections">
            <h2>Will there be anything besides alcohol there?</h2>
            <p>Yes, there will also be plenty of water and snacks to go around! Drinkpocalypse is fun, so we don't want to drink so much that we can't remember it. This year's Drinkpocalypse will
                be the first year in which we impliment a mandatory water drinking policy, as a matter of best practice.
            </p>

        <section class="faq-sections">
            <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
            <p>All you really <em>need</em> to bring is yourself and something that you can wear to the pool. Nothing else is required! If there's a certain drink or snack that you absolutely want to have
            during the event, then you are more than welcome to bring it. The more the merrier!
            </p>

        <section class="faq-sections">
            <h2>What else should I know?</h2>
            <p>In order to encourage full participation in the event, everyone will be bribed with a free t-shirt as a participation trophy, and there will also be various awards that anyone can win!
                You can read more about the various awards on the <a href="awards.html">awards page</a>.
